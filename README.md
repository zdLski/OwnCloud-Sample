## Get Started with ownCloud

ownCloud is an open source cloud platform where you can securely store and share files on desktop or mobile. You can customize your deployment configurations depending on the hardware, database systems, and apps that you choose to use with it. 

This quickstart covers a basic installation using the ownCloud Appliance, which bundles together the software dependencies for ownCloud and includes an installer. The ownCloud Appliance allows you to try out the different ownCloud features without commiting to a full custom install if you have integration preferences. 

If you want to get started quickly with a fully customizable ownCloud, try the Docker Installation by following the more detailed [Installing with Docker](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.3/admin_manual/installation/docker/) documentation.
